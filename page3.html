    <p>
      The roses finally fall apart into pure pattern. No petals, just pixels shaped
      like petals. No perfume, just the ghost of how it felt.
    </p>

    <p class="whisper">
      &ldquo;I kept your night for you,&rdquo; the garden says.<br>
      &ldquo;I saved it and saved it and saved it.<br>
      Now the file only remembers roses and light.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      You realize the memory is more aesthetic than accurate. It is not lying,
      it is just wearing too much glitter. The story does not end; it just reloads.
    </p>

    <p>
      Can you believe this garden, and can you believe this loop, and can you believe
      you are about to start over like nothing glitched at all?
